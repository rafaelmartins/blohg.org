About blohg
===========

blohg_ is a Mercurial_-based blogging engine written in Python_, built on the
top of the Flask_ micro-framework and some of its extensions. All the content of
the blogs are stored inside Mercurial_ repositories, and the repository history
is used to build the posts and pages.

Motivation
----------

Everybody knows that we have a large number of blogging engines lying around the
blogosphere, but there are not a many choices for programmers, who are used to
working daily with source-code editors and version control systems and may be more
productive when blogging using these tools, instead of the fancy WYSIWYG_
editors and administration interfaces.

Actually this isn't the first project trying to implement a VCS_-based blogging
engine, but most of the existing projects aren't tied to a VCS_ and are just
using text files that can be versioned with a VCS_, without taking full
advantage of the VCS's revision history.

This project uses Mercurial_ as the VCS_, reStructuredText_ as the markup
language and Jinja2_ as the template engine. All of these are pretty popular
within the Python ecosystem and easy to use.
