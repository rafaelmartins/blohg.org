blohg-0.12
==========

.. tags: announcements, releases

Almost 1 year after blohg-0.11, blohg-0.12 is out! Get it while it is hot! :)

New features:

- Git support (Experimental). It is mostly transparent. Users just need to
  convert they sources repository, or create a new one with
  ``blohg initrepo --git``.
- `Extensions support`_ (Experimental). This feature isn't properly documented
  yet, take a look at a `real world example`_ if you want to write your own
  extension :)
- Better test coverage. It isn't perfect yet, but the important bits are
  reasonably tested now.

Read the documentation_ for more details.
