blohg 0.8 was just released.

This version comes with a few improvements:

- added `post aliases`_ support. Thanks to Christian Joergensen.
- added some code to allow the usage of `blohg as a CMS`_ (Content Management
  System), without blog posts at all.

.. _`post aliases`: http://docs.blohg.org/write/#post-aliases
.. _`blohg as a CMS`: http://docs.blohg.org/new-blog/#using-blohg-as-a-cms

See the documentation_ for more info.
