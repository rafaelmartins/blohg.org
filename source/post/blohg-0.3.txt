Hi all,

I'm proud to announce the release of the version 0.3 of blohg, and our new
website (http://blohg.org/).

This version comes with improved documentation_ and a Mercurial_ repository
template, that should make it easier for people to get blohg running.

.. _documentation: http://docs.blohg.org/
.. _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/

I hope you all enjoy!

Thanks!
