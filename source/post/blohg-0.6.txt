.. tags: announcements, releases

blohg 0.6 is out!

This version comes with support to Flask 0.7. blohg will no more work with
older versions of Flask.

There's also some other minor improvements:

- Fixed customized Jinja2_ loader that gets templates from the Mercurial_
  repository.
- Improved handling of static files from the Mercurial_ repository.
- Improved automatic reload of Mercurial_ stuff when a new changeset is pushed
  to the production server.

.. _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/

Thanks!
