blohg 0.7 was just released.

This version comes with some nice new features:

- added label support for ``:attachment:`` roles.
- added author name and email to the metadata API. Useful for show the author
  of each post in metadata.
- the production setup now uses to the ``default`` branch instead of the ``tip``
  revision. Useful for people who want to setup a branch for drafts. Just
  commit your drafts to a separated branch and merge them in ``default`` when
  done.
